# Decision Tree Project README

## Overview

This repository contains a basic decision tree project implemented in Python using pandas and scikit-learn. The project focuses on predicting whether a customer will make a purchase based on demographic and behavioral data.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Directory containing the input CSV files.

  - `List of Orders.csv`: Customer order details.
  - `Order Details.csv`: Order-specific details.
  - `Sales target.csv`: Sales targets.
- `DT.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the project implementation.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Import and Preprocessing:**

   - Loaded data from CSV files.
   - Merged datasets based on common columns.
2. **Target Variable Creation:**

   - Created a binary target variable indicating whether a purchase was made.
3. **Feature Selection:**

   - Selected relevant features for prediction.
4. **Data Splitting:**

   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
5. **Model Training:**

   - Implemented a decision tree classifier.
   - Trained the model using the training set.
6. **Model Evaluation:**

   - Evaluated the model's performance on the testing set.
7. **Adjusting Model Complexity:**

   - Adjusted the hyperparameters (max_depth) to prevent overfitting.
8. **Cross-Validation:**

   - Performed cross-validation to assess the model's performance on different data subsets.
9. **Feature Importance and Visualization:**

   - Explored feature importance.
   - Visualized the decision tree.
10. **Additional Analysis:**

    - Examined feature distributions and correlations.

## Usage and Benefits

- **Decision Tree Model:**

  - The decision tree model predicts whether a customer will make a purchase based on provided features.
  - Useful for identifying patterns and factors influencing purchase decisions.
- **Feature Importance:**

  - Feature importance analysis highlights the most influential factors in predicting purchases.
  - Provides insights into which features contribute significantly to the model's decision-making.
- **Visualization:**

  - The decision tree visualization aids in understanding how the model makes predictions.
  - Useful for explaining and interpreting the model to stakeholders.
- **Next Steps:**

  - Explore further analyses, such as trying different models or incorporating additional features.
  - Consider model deployment for making predictions on new data.
